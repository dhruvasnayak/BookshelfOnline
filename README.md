Online Book Sharing Website
Welcome to the Online Book Sharing Website! This platform allows users to explore, upload, and share their favorite books with a community of readers. The website is built using React for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and Firebase for storing and managing the books.

Features
Browse Books: Explore a vast collection of books uploaded by other users. The user-friendly interface makes it easy to search for books by title, author, genre, or keywords.

Upload Books: Share your favorite books with the community by uploading them to the platform. Simply fill out the book details, attach the book file, and let others enjoy your recommendations.

Book Details: Each book has a dedicated page displaying its cover, title, author, description, and other relevant information. Users can rate and leave reviews for the books they've read.

Technologies Used
Frontend: The frontend is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides a dynamic and interactive experience for users as they browse and interact with the website.

Backend: The backend is powered by Node.js, a server-side JavaScript runtime. It handles user authentication, book uploads, search functionality, and communicates with the Firebase database.

Database: Firebase is used as the database and storage solution. It securely stores book files, user profiles, and book metadata. Firebase's real-time capabilities ensure that new uploads and updates are reflected instantly.
